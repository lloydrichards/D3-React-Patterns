# D3-React Patterns

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

[Live Site](https://lloydrichards.github.io/D3-React-Patterns/)

Collection of various techniques and patterns for organizing a D3 project inside a larger React Framework. This will be an open repo for anyone to contribute to, more detail can be found in the DVS slack.

The challenge here is to represent different ways of implementing D3 into React. This is not to see which is 'best' but rather to see different techniques and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. In order to make the comparison, each Pattern should use the same data source and present it in three separate chart, that can be interacted with to update all the charts at once.

While viewing the pages on the web is nice, the real show is here in the repo where you can see the code and compare the different implementations

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" to your `snowpack.config.js` config file.

### npm test

Launches the application test runner.
Run with the `--watch` flag (`npm test -- --watch`) to run in interactive watch mode.
